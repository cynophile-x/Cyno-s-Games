Here is the link to all the "math games":
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FmH3BlSBQI7FGgAQL59-ZPe8eCxs35wel6JUyVaG8Q/edit?tab=t.0

Run in a codespace or download the files and use in a browser (i'd recommend downloading error.html. index.html, and a couple of games in the case github gets filtered)

How to run:
1. Run "npm install -g http-server" and wait until npm is installed
2. Run "http-server"
3. Click "Make Public" on the VS notification
